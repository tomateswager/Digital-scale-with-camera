In this project, the goal is to implement a digital scale integrated with a camera module capable of recognizing three regional products: banana, passion fruit, and tangerine. The digital scale will be used by a regional company to form baskets up to 2000g, containing smaller packages of 500g (packaging + fruit) of these products. The baskets can be made of a single type of product or a combination of them.

The maximum price of the products is â‚¬5, a value that will be an input in the system. Additionally, there will be a variable tax, calculated as 3 times the result of the remainder of the integer division by 9 of the sum of the digits of the number of the oldest student in the group. If the remainder is 0, 9 is used by default. The system must show the final price with and without the tax.

The circuit inputs include the outputs from the camera module, the weight of the selected product (multiples of 500g), and an end-of-purchase button. The outputs are the partial/final sum (amount to be paid), the indication of the receipt issuance, and the value of the applied tax.

The project must be partially developed in Verilog and partially through electrical schematics, without the use of flip-flops or other basic memory components from the ISE software library of Xilinx. If necessary, flip-flops can be created in Verilog.

Integration with previous solutions is allowed, with possible modifications. The work includes a short report of up to 6 pages, excluding the cover, with an introduction, conclusion, and discussion of the implementation options. It is mandatory to include in the report an image of the circuit's electrical schematic in ISE, without cuts. The complete project must be submitted by December 23rd and presented later.

This project will be evaluated based on the choice of solutions, justifications, minimal hardware usage, report quality, robustness of the solution, results proving the good functioning of the circuit, and respect for established deadlines.
